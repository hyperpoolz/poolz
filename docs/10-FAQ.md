# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## ü§î General Questions

### What is HyperLoops?

HyperLoops is a revolutionary no-loss lottery protocol built on Hyperliquid EVM. Users deposit wHYPE tokens which are automatically supplied to HyperLend lending pools to generate yield. This yield is pooled together and distributed to winners through daily lottery drawings, while users can withdraw their original deposits at any time.

### How does a "no-loss" lottery work?

Unlike traditional lotteries where you lose your money if you don't win, HyperLoops preserves your principal investment:

1. **Deposit Safety**: Your deposited wHYPE tokens remain fully withdrawable
2. **Yield Generation**: Deposits earn 5-20% APY through HyperLend
3. **Prize Distribution**: Only the generated yield forms the prize pool
4. **Win-Win System**: Everyone either wins prizes or earns guaranteed yield

### Is HyperLoops safe to use?

HyperLoops is designed with multiple safety mechanisms:

- ‚úÖ **Principal Protection**: Your deposits are always safe and withdrawable
- ‚úÖ **Open Source**: All smart contracts are publicly auditable
- ‚úÖ **Battle-Tested Infrastructure**: Built on HyperLend (Aave V3 compatible)
- ‚úÖ **Emergency Controls**: Pause mechanism for emergency situations
- ‚úÖ **No Loss Guarantee**: You can never lose your deposited principal

**Risk Considerations:**
- Smart contract risks (like any DeFi protocol)
- HyperLend protocol dependency
- Yield fluctuation based on market conditions

## üí∞ Financial & Economic Questions

### How much can I earn with HyperLoops?

Your earnings depend on several factors:

**Guaranteed Yield (Auto-compound option):**
- 5-20% APY from HyperLend lending markets
- Compounded automatically if you choose 0% lottery allocation

**Lottery Winnings (Potential):**
- Prize pool varies based on total deposits and yield generated
- Win probability proportional to your tickets
- Historical average prizes: 50-500 wHYPE per drawing

**Example Scenarios:**
```
Deposit: 1000 wHYPE
Scenario 1 (100% lottery): 0 guaranteed yield, lottery tickets
Scenario 2 (50% lottery): ~50-100 wHYPE/year yield + lottery tickets  
Scenario 3 (0% lottery): ~50-200 wHYPE/year guaranteed yield
```

### What are the fees?

HyperLoops has minimal fees:
- **Deposit/Withdrawal Fees**: 0%
- **Protocol Fee**: 1% of prize winnings (configurable by governance)
- **Gas Fees**: Standard Hyperliquid EVM transaction costs (very low)
- **HyperLend Fees**: None for lending (standard Aave V3 model)

### How are lottery tickets calculated?

Tickets are awarded based on your yield contribution:
- **Ticket Unit**: 0.01 wHYPE worth of yield = 1 ticket
- **Minimum**: Contributors get at least 1 ticket if contributing any yield
- **Proportional**: More yield contribution = more tickets = higher win probability

**Example:**
```
Your deposit: 1000 wHYPE
Daily yield: 0.5 wHYPE (at 18% APY)
Lottery allocation: 100%
Tickets earned: 50 tickets (0.5 √∑ 0.01)
```

### When do lotteries occur?

- **Frequency**: Daily lotteries every 24 hours
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
- **Transparent**: All drawings are recorded on-chain
- **Fair**: Verifiable random selection process

## üé≤ Lottery Mechanics

### How are winners selected?

HyperLoops uses a fair, weighted random selection:

1. **Random Generation**: Secure pseudo-random number generation
2. **Ticket-based Selection**: Winners selected proportional to ticket holdings
3. **Single Winner**: One winner per daily drawing
4. **Transparent Process**: All selections recorded on-chain

**Selection Algorithm:**
```
1. Generate random number R
2. Calculate target = R % totalTickets
3. Iterate through participants
4. Select winner when cumulative tickets > target
```

### Can I improve my winning chances?

Yes, through several strategies:

**Increase Deposit Size:**
- Larger deposits generate more yield
- More yield = more tickets = higher win probability

**Optimize Allocation:**
- 100% lottery allocation maximizes tickets
- Lower allocation provides guaranteed yield

**Hold Longer:**
- Yield accumulates over time
- More accumulated yield = more tickets

**But Remember:** Even small depositors can win due to random selection!

### What happens if I'm the only participant?

- **Guaranteed Win**: You'll win every lottery drawing
- **Prize Pool**: All accumulated yield goes to you
- **Efficiency**: Effectively becomes a high-yield savings account
- **Growth Potential**: As more users join, prize pools grow larger

### How are prizes distributed?

**Winner Receives:**
- Full prize pool amount (minus 1% protocol fee)
- Instant transfer to winner's wallet
- wHYPE tokens (can be unwrapped to native HYPE)

**After Drawing:**
- All tickets reset to zero
- New ticket accumulation begins
- Next lottery scheduled for 24 hours later
