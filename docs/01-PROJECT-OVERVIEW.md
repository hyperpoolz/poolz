# Project Overview

## 🎯 What is HyperLoops?

HyperLoops is a groundbreaking no-loss lottery protocol built on Hyperliquid EVM that revolutionizes how users participate in lotteries. Unlike traditional lotteries where participants risk losing their money, HyperLoops ensures that users never lose their principal investment while still having the chance to win substantial prizes.

## 🔄 How It Works

### The No-Loss Lottery Mechanism

1. **Deposit Phase**
   - Users deposit wHYPE tokens into the HyperLoops protocol
   - Deposits are automatically supplied to HyperLend lending pools
   - Users receive lottery tickets based on their deposit amount and duration

2. **Yield Generation**
   - Deposited funds earn 5-20% APY through HyperLend's lending markets
   - Yield is accumulated in a collective prize pool
   - Users retain full ownership of their principal

3. **Daily Lottery**
   - Every 24 hours, a lottery drawing occurs
   - Winners are selected using a fair, weighted random system
   - Prize pool is distributed to winners
   - Tickets are reset for the next round

4. **Withdrawal**
   - Users can withdraw their principal at any time
   - No penalties or lock-up periods
   - Instant access to funds when needed

### Key Innovation: User-Configurable Yield Allocation

HyperLoops introduces a unique feature where users can control what percentage of their generated yield goes to the lottery:

- **100% (Default)**: All yield goes to lottery, maximum ticket potential
- **75%**: 75% to lottery, 25% auto-compounded to user's deposit
- **50%**: 50% to lottery, 50% auto-compounded
- **25%**: 25% to lottery, 75% auto-compounded
- **0%**: All yield auto-compounded, no lottery participation

This flexibility allows users to balance between lottery participation and guaranteed yield accumulation.

## 🎲 Lottery Mechanics

### Ticket System

Tickets are earned through yield contribution:
- **Ticket Unit**: 0.01 wHYPE worth of yield = 1 ticket
- **Minimum**: Users contributing any yield get at least 1 ticket
- **Weight-based**: More yield contribution = more tickets = higher win probability

### Winner Selection

```
Selection Process:
1. Generate secure random number
2. Calculate target = randomNumber % totalTickets  
3. Iterate through participants
4. Select winner when cumulative tickets > target
```

### Prize Distribution

- **Single Winner**: One winner per daily drawing
- **Full Prize**: Winner receives entire accumulated prize pool
- **Immediate Transfer**: Instant wHYPE token transfer to winner

## 💰 Economic Model

### Revenue Sources

- **No Protocol Fees**: HyperLoops charges no fees to users
- **Yield Maximization**: 100% of generated yield goes to prize pools or users
- **Sustainable Growth**: Protocol grows through increased deposits and participation

### Risk Management

- **Principal Protection**: Smart contract design ensures no principal loss
- **Yield Risk**: Only generated yield is at risk in lottery system
- **Smart Contract Risk**: Audited code with emergency controls
- **HyperLend Risk**: Dependent on HyperLend protocol security
