npx hardhat verify --network hyperevm_mainnet DEPLOYED_ADDRESS \
  "0x00A89d7a5A02160f20150EbEA7a2b5E4879A1A8b" \
  "0x5481bf8d3946E6A3168640c1D7523eB59F055a29" \
  "0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555"

# Update frontend configuration
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_LOTTERY_CONTRACT=DEPLOYED_ADDRESS" >> frontend/.env.production
```

### Demo Environment Setup
```javascript
// scripts/setup-demo.js
const DEMO_ACCOUNTS = [
  "0x...", // Demo account 1
  "0x...", // Demo account 2
  "0x...", // Demo account 3
];

const DEMO_DEPOSITS = [
  { account: DEMO_ACCOUNTS[0], amount: "1000" },
  { account: DEMO_ACCOUNTS[1], amount: "500" },
  { account: DEMO_ACCOUNTS[2], amount: "750" },
];

async function setupDemo() {
  console.log("ðŸŽ¬ Setting up demo environment...");
  
  // Deploy fresh contract for demo
  const lottery = await deployContract();
  
  // Fund demo accounts with wHYPE
  await fundDemoAccounts();
  
  // Create initial deposits
  for (const deposit of DEMO_DEPOSITS) {
    await makeDeposit(deposit.account, deposit.amount);
  }
  
  // Wait for yield accumulation (or simulate)
  await simulateYieldAccrual();
  
  // Execute a few lottery rounds
  await executeDemoLotteries(3);
  
  console.log("âœ… Demo environment ready!");
  console.log(`Contract: ${lottery.address}`);
  console.log(`Total Deposits: ${await lottery.totalDeposits()}`);
  console.log(`Prize Pool: ${await lottery.prizePool()}`);
}
```
