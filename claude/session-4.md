## Implementation Plan

### Core Function Signatures
```solidity
// Lottery Execution
function executeLottery() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused;
function canExecuteLottery() external view returns (bool);
function getWinnerProbability(address user) external view returns (uint256);

// Winner Selection
function _selectWinner(uint256 randomSeed) internal returns (address);
function _generateRandomness() internal view returns (uint256);
function _distributePrize(address winner, uint256 amount) internal;

// Lottery State
function getCurrentLotteryInfo() external view returns (
    uint256 round,
    uint256 prizePool,
    uint256 totalTickets,
    uint256 participantCount,
    uint256 timeToNext
);

// History & Stats
function getLotteryHistory(uint256 round) external view returns (LotteryResult memory);
function getWinnerHistory() external view returns (address[] memory);
```

### Randomness Strategy (MVP)
```solidity
function _generateRandomness() internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Combine multiple sources for basic randomness
    // Note: Not cryptographically secure, but sufficient for MVP
    return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        block.timestamp,
        block.difficulty,
        block.number,
        blockhash(block.number - 1),
        totalDeposits,
        participants.length
    )));
}
```

### Weighted Winner Selection
```solidity
function _selectWinner(uint256 randomSeed) internal returns (address) {
    require(participants.length > 0, "No participants");
    
    // Calculate total ticket weight
    uint256 totalWeight = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < participants.length; i++) {
        totalWeight += users[participants[i]].tickets;
    }
    
    // Generate random target within total weight
    uint256 target = randomSeed % totalWeight;
    
    // Find winner by walking through weighted tickets
    uint256 currentWeight = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < participants.length; i++) {
        address participant = participants[i];
        currentWeight += users[participant].tickets;
        
        if (currentWeight > target) {
            return participant;
        }
    }
    
    // Fallback to first participant
    return participants[0];
}
```

### Complete Lottery Execution
```solidity
function executeLottery() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    require(canExecuteLottery(), "Lottery not ready");
    require(prizePool > 0, "No prize to distribute");
    require(participants.length > 0, "No participants");
    
    // Generate randomness
    uint256 randomSeed = _generateRandomness();
    
    // Select winner
    address winner = _selectWinner(randomSeed);
    uint256 prize = prizePool;
    
    // Distribute prize
    _distributePrize(winner, prize);
    
    // Record lottery result
    lotteryHistory[currentRound] = LotteryResult({
        round: currentRound,
        winner: winner,
        prize: prize,
        totalParticipants: participants.length,
        totalTickets: getTotalTickets(),
        timestamp: block.timestamp,
        randomSeed: randomSeed
    });
    
    // Reset for next round
    _resetLottery();
    
    emit LotteryExecuted(winner, prize, currentRound);
}
```

### Prize Distribution
```solidity
function _distributePrize(address winner, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(winner != address(0), "Invalid winner");
    require(amount > 0, "No prize to distribute");
    
    // Transfer prize to winner
    depositToken.safeTransfer(winner, amount);
    
    // Update prize pool
    prizePool = 0;
    
    // Record winner in history
    winners.push(winner);
    
    emit PrizeDistributed(winner, amount, currentRound);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Randomness Testing**
   - Random seed generation consistency
   - Distribution fairness over multiple runs
   - Edge case handling (single participant)
   - Deterministic testing with fixed seeds

2. **Winner Selection**
   - Weighted selection accuracy
   - Multiple participants with different ticket counts
   - Equal ticket scenarios
   - Large participant pools

3. **Prize Distribution**
   - Correct prize transfer to winner
   - Prize pool reset after distribution
   - Event emission verification
   - Failed transfer handling

4. **Lottery Lifecycle**
   - Round progression and state management
   - Timing constraints and readiness checks
   - Multiple lottery cycles
   - History tracking accuracy

### Mock Testing Scenarios
```javascript
describe("Random Winner Selection", () => {
  it("Should select winner proportional to tickets", async () => {
    // Setup: User A with 70 tickets, User B with 30 tickets
    // Run lottery 1000 times, verify ~70/30 distribution
  });
  
  it("Should handle single participant", async () => {
    // Only one user should always win
  });
  
  it("Should reset properly after lottery", async () => {
    // Verify round increment, prize pool reset, etc.
  });
});
```

## User Interface Requirements

### Lottery Status Display
- Current lottery round information
- Time until next lottery execution
- Current prize pool amount
- Total participants and tickets
- User's win probability percentage

### Winner Announcement
- Animated winner reveal
- Prize amount display
- Winner's wallet address (truncated)
- Congratulations modal/popup
- Social sharing capabilities

### Lottery History
- Past winners and prize amounts
- Historical lottery statistics
- User's participation history
- Win/loss tracking
- Prize pool growth over time

## Advanced Features (Stretch Goals)

### Enhanced Randomness
```solidity
// Commit-Reveal Scheme for Better Randomness
mapping(address => bytes32) public commitments;
mapping(uint256 => uint256) public reveals;

function commitRandom(bytes32 commitment) external;
function revealRandom(uint256 nonce) external;
function executeWithCommitReveal() external;
```

### Chainlink VRF Integration
```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol";

contract NoLossLotteryVRF is VRFConsumerBaseV2 {
    function requestRandomWords() external returns (uint256 requestId);
    function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override;
}
```

## Demo Capabilities
After Session 4 completion:

1. **Complete Lottery Cycle**: Deposit â†’ Yield â†’ Harvest â†’ Lottery â†’ Winner
2. **Fair Selection**: Demonstrate weighted random selection based on tickets
3. **Prize Distribution**: Show automatic prize transfer to winner
4. **Round Progression**: Multiple lottery rounds with history tracking
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Show win probability calculations and fairness

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Lottery executes successfully with fair winner selection
- [ ] Prize distributed correctly to winners
- [ ] Random selection appears fair over multiple runs
- [ ] All edge cases handled properly (single user, equal tickets)
- [ ] Lottery history tracked accurately
- [ ] Gas-efficient lottery execution
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (25+ tests)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Randomness Quality**: Multiple entropy sources, plan for VRF upgrade
2. **Winner Selection Fairness**: Extensive testing with different scenarios
3. **Prize Transfer Security**: Use SafeERC20 for secure transfers
4. **Gas Costs**: Optimize for reasonable execution costs
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle all participant count scenarios

## Dependencies
- Session 3 completion: yield harvesting and ticket allocation
- Sufficient test users with deposits and tickets
- Mock yield accumulation for realistic testing

## Files to Modify/Create
- `contracts/NoLossLottery.sol` - Add lottery execution logic
- `contracts/interfaces/IRandomness.sol` - Randomness interface (future VRF)
- `test/LotteryExecution.test.js` - Comprehensive lottery testing
- `scripts/run-lottery-demo.js` - End-to-end lottery demonstration
- `scripts/lottery-statistics.js` - Statistical analysis tools

**Session 4 Dependencies**: Requires Sessions 2 & 3 for complete user deposit and yield system.
